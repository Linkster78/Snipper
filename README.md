By default, the key for taking a "Snip" is NUMPAD8 and the key to open the GUI is NUMPAD9 but those can be changed in the settings menu.

Don't have a numpad ? Simply go to your Tray (Arrow facing upwards on your taskbar) and right click on the Snipper icon -> GUI

In order to save and upload snips, open the GUI and simply click on a Snip to copy it OR right click it to access many options.

On the top menu bar, there is also an option to bulk-save snips, an option to close the process as well as modify Hotkeys and Clear the snip list
